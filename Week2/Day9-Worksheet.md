# Day 9 Worksheet: Scalability and Performance

## Objectives

- Implement scaling strategies
- Optimize system performance
- Measure and monitor performance
- Apply Isorythm optimization patterns

## Exercise 1: Horizontal Scaling

Implement system that scales by adding more agents.

## Exercise 2: Performance Optimization

Apply optimization techniques:
- Caching
- Indexing
- Message batching
- Connection pooling

## Exercise 3: Performance Measurement

Build performance monitoring system to measure:
- Communication overhead
- Task completion times
- Resource utilization
- System throughput

## Reflection Questions

1. **What scaling strategy** fits your system?
2. **How do you measure** if optimizations are effective?
3. **What performance bottlenecks** did you identify?

## Next Steps

- Complete exercises
- Commit work
- Prepare for Day 10: Integration Patterns
