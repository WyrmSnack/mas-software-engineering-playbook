# Day 10 Worksheet: Integration Patterns

## Objectives

- Design REST API for agent system
- Implement API endpoints
- Build integration with external systems
- Apply Isorythm API patterns

## Exercise 1: REST API Design

Design and implement REST API with:
- Workflow management endpoints
- Agent management endpoints
- Task management endpoints
- Execution tracking endpoints

## Exercise 2: API Implementation

Implement API using FastAPI (like Isorythm) with:
- CRUD operations
- Execution endpoints
- Status tracking
- Error handling

## Exercise 3: External Integration

Integrate your agent system with:
- External service (e.g., database, file system)
- API client
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Reflection Questions

1. **What API design principles** are most important?
2. **How does Isorythm's API** compare to your design?
3. **What integration challenges** did you encounter?

## Next Steps

- Complete exercises
- Commit work
- Prepare for Week 3: Advanced Orchestration
