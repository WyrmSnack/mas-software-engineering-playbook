# Days 16-17: Capstone Project Planning & Initial Implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Days 16-17, you will be able to:
- Select and scope a capstone project
- Design complete multi-agent system architecture
- Set up development environment
- Implement core components
- Establish agent interaction patterns

## Capstone Project Requirements

Your capstone project should demonstrate:

1. **Effective MAS Design**: Core MAS concepts, agent architectures, communication
2. **Advanced Orchestration**: Complex task coordination and dynamic adaptation
3. **Emergent Behavior**: Leveraging or managing emergent properties
4. **Self-Adaptive Loop**: MAPE-K (Monitor, Analyze, Plan, Execute - Knowledge) or similar
5. **Complete Application**: Functional software system
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation
7. **Quality**: Production-ready code with tests

## Project Selection

### Suggested Project Ideas

1. **Self-Adaptive Code Review System**
   - Agents: Security Reviewer, Performance Analyst, Style Checker, Documentation Writer
   - Adaptation: Adjust review criteria based on code quality trends
   - MAPE-K: Monitor code quality, analyze trends, plan improvements, execute reviews

2. **Intelligent Development Workflow**
   - Agents: Planner, Coder, Tester, Reviewer, Deployer
   - Adaptation: Optimize workflow based on project characteristics
   - MAPE-K: Monitor workflow performance, analyze bottlenecks, plan optimizations, execute changes

3. **Adaptive Testing System**
   - Agents: Test Generator, Test Executor, Coverage Analyzer, Bug Reporter
   - Adaptation: Focus testing on high-risk areas
   - MAPE-K: Monitor coverage, analyze risk, plan test strategy, execute tests

## Day 16: Planning and Design

### Morning: Project Selection and Requirements

1. **Select Project**: Choose project that interests you
2. **Define Requirements**: Clear functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Scope Definition**: Define what's in and out of scope

### Afternoon: Architecture Design

1. **Agent Design**: Define agent roles, capabilities, interactions
2. **Architecture Selection**: Choose appropriate architecture (hierarchical, P2P, hybrid, etc.)
3. **Communication Patterns**: Design communication mechanisms
4. **Coordination Strategy**: Define coordination approach

### Deliverables Day 16

- [ ] Project proposal document
- [ ] Architecture design document
- [ ] Agent specifications
- [ ] Communication and coordination design

## Day 17: Initial Implementation

### Morning: Environment Setup

1. **Development Environment**: Set up project structure
2. **Dependencies**: Install required packages
3. **Database Setup**: Configure state persistence
4. **Testing Framework**: Set up testing infrastructure

### Afternoon: Core Implementation

1. **Base Components**: Implement base agent, message bus, etc.
2. **Agent Implementations**: Create specialized agents
3. **Coordination**: Implement coordination mechanisms
4. **Initial Testing**: Basic functionality tests

### Deliverables Day 17

- [ ] Project repository set up
- [ ] Core components implemented
- [ ] Initial agent implementations
- [ ] Basic tests passing
