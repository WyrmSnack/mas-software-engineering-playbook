# Day 11 Worksheet: Emergent Behavior and Self-Organization

## Objectives

- Implement self-organizing agents
- Observe emergent behavior
- Design swarm intelligence system
- Analyze emergent properties

## Exercise 1: Self-Organizing Agents

Create agents that self-organize based on local rules and neighbor interactions.

## Exercise 2: Emergent Behavior Observation

Build system and observe what behaviors emerge from agent interactions.

## Exercise 3: Swarm Intelligence

Implement swarm intelligence pattern (e.g., particle swarm, ant colony).

## Reflection Questions

1. **What emergent behaviors** did you observe?
2. **How do simple rules** create complex behavior?
3. **What are the benefits** and challenges of self-organization?

## Next Steps

- Complete exercises
- Commit work
- Prepare for Day 12: Adaptive and Learning Agents

---

**Fascinating!** Emergent behavior is powerful. Tomorrow: adaptive learning.
