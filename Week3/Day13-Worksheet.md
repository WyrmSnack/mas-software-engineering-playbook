# Day 13 Worksheet: Distributed Agent Systems

## Objectives

- Design network topology
- Implement consensus algorithm
- Build distributed coordination
- Handle network partitions

## Exercise 1: Network Topology

Design and implement network topology for distributed agent system.

## Exercise 2: Consensus Protocol

Implement consensus algorithm for distributed agreement.

## Exercise 3: Partition Recovery

Build system that detects and recovers from network partitions.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What topology** fits your distributed system?
2. **How does consensus** enable distributed coordination?
3. **What are the challenges** of distributed systems?

## Next Steps

- Complete exercises
- Commit work
- Prepare for Day 14: Monitoring and Observability

---

**Great work!** Tomorrow: monitoring and observability.
