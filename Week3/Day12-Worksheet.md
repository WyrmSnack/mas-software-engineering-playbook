# Day 12 Worksheet: Adaptive and Learning Agents

## Objectives

- Implement reinforcement learning agent
- Build adaptive behavior system
- Create learning from experience mechanism
- Test agent improvement over time

## Exercise 1: Reinforcement Learning

Implement Q-learning agent that learns optimal actions.

## Exercise 2: Adaptive Behavior

Create agent that adapts strategy based on performance.

## Exercise 3: Learning from Experience

Build system where agents learn from their own and others' experiences.

## Reflection Questions

1. **How does reinforcement learning** improve agent performance?
2. **What are the challenges** of adaptive behavior?
3. **How do you measure** if learning is effective?

## Next Steps

- Complete exercises
- Commit work
- Prepare for Day 13: Distributed Agent Systems

---

**Excellent!** Learning agents are powerful. Tomorrow: distributed systems.
